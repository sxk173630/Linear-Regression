INTRODUCTION
------------
These files contain python code for implementing the gradient descent algorithm, and apply it to a linear regression problem that used a Beijing multi-site air-quality data set and compared the, CO concentration(carbon monoxide) by the TEMP(Temperature in celsius) with pre-processing included.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Used an ML library that performs linear regression from Scikit Learn package. https://scikit-learn.org
on the dataset.

INSTALLATION
------------
I have the .py file, "Linear_Regression", that uses the, "PRSA_Data_Changping.txt", to implement the dataset.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
The original dataset link:

I have included the actual file containing the dataset as well entitled: PRSA_Data_Changping
